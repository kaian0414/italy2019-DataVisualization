## Introduction
Creating imageries to present data is one of the effective way to transmit information. This kind of visual aids can let receivers understand the information quickly. It is widely used in various disciplines, such as maps, statistics diagrams and trend charts.

#### Overview
An idea of this project is to build up a webpage to display the lectures and related classrooms in a timetable format. There are different kinds of existing libraries to establish the diagrams, such as D3.js and Chart.js, and both of them can also be used to visualize data. However, we did not use any one of them to finish this visualization demo as we would like to design a diagram with our own ideas which can let users have a nice browsing experience.

In this project, we built up a schedule page in a timetable format. The presented data is provided by the University of Bologna which includes the lectures, classroom and time information of a day. By fetching the data from the provided XML file, we can display it within our designed UI interface. As our goal is to let users notice the target lessons and related information clearly with a nice browsing experience, we paid more attention on the visual effects. We mainly chose to use fresh colour, rounded corners and one of the famous graceful font. This kind of design can let users feel more comfortable.
